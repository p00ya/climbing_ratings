# Climbing Ratings

Climbing Ratings is software that estimates ratings for the sport of rock climbing.  The ratings can be used to predict route difficulty and climber performance on a particular route.

Climbing Ratings is Copyright 2019 Dean Scarff.

The algorithms are based on the "WHR" paper:

> RÃ©mi Coulom, "Whole-History Rating: A Bayesian Rating System for Players of Time-Varying Strength", <https://www.remi-coulom.fr/WHR/WHR.pdf>.

Equivalences to the WHR model are:

-   Climbers are players.
-   Ascents are games.
-   A clean ascent is a "win" for the climber.

Notable differences are:

-   Routes are like players except their rating does not change with time.
-   The gamma distribution is used for the prior distribution of route and initial climber ratings.
-   A "page" is the model of a climber in a particular time interval (like a page in a climber's logbook).  This is equivalent to a player on a particular day in WHR, except that the time may be quantized with lower resolution (e.g. a week).

## Contents and Usage

### Python library

The estimation algorithms are implemented in Python and Cython, in the `climbing_ratings` package.  Some effort has been taken to optimize parts of the code for speed, namely by leveraging numpy for vectorized operations and using Cython to reduce Python overheads and allow C compilers to generate vectorized CPU instructions.

The package can be built using:

```
python3 setup.py build
```

Unit tests can be run using:

```
python3 setup.py test
```

### Estimation script

The Python script `02-run_estimation.py` reads in a set of CSV files and writes out the estimated ratings for pages and routes as CSV files.  To read and write CSV files from the `data/` directory, it can be run like:

```
python3 02-run_estimation.py data
```

It will typically run in less than 5 seconds per 100,000 ascents (measured on an Intel Core i5-8210Y).

### R scripts

A collection of R scripts are used for data preparation and results analysis.  They can be sourced into an R session.  The scripts use several libraries from the "tidyverse" collection.  Additionally, to read JSON data from theCrag API responses, the "jsonlite" package is required.  The packages can be installed from R:

```
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "jsonlite"))
```

Together, `00-data_prep_functions.R` and `01-data_prep.R` create appropriate input CSV files for `02-run_estimation.py`.

The `03-post_estimation.R` script merges the estimation results with the data frames created by `01-data_prep.R`, and produces some plots that can be used to analyze the model fit.

With the file `data/raw_ascents.csv` already present, the entire pipeline can be run from R:

```
data_dir <- "data"
source("00-data_prep_functions.R")
source("01-data_prep.R")
system2("./02-run_estimation.py", data_dir)
source("03-post_estimation.R")
```

The `raw_ascents.csv` file can be regenerated from a directory containing CSV logbook exports from theCrag.  Having sourced `00-data_prep_functions.R`, and with the logbooks in the directory "logbooks":

```
write.csv(
  ReadLogbooks("logbooks"),
  "data/raw_ascents.csv",
  quote = FALSE,
  row.names = FALSE
)
```

Instead of reading the ascents data from logbook exports, it can instead be read from the JSON responses returned by theCrag's API.  With files like `data/ascents-01.json` present, replace `source("01-data_prep.R")` in the pipeline above with:

```
source("01-data_prep_json.R")
```

## Interpreting ratings

Ratings come in two flavours; the `gamma` rating and the "natural" rating `r`; they are related by `gamma = exp(r)`.

Suppose a climber whose current rating is `gamma_i` attempts to climb a route with rating `gamma_j`.  The model predicts the probability of the ascent being clean as:

```
    P(clean) = gamma_i / (gamma_i + gamma_j)
```
