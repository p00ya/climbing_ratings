[Climbing Ratings](https://github.com/p00ya/climbing_ratings) is software that estimates ratings for the sport of rock climbing.  The ratings can be used to predict route difficulty and climber performance on a particular route.

The ratings are based on ascent success data.  Each ascent is classified as successful or unsuccessful.  The ratings of the route and climber are updated based on all the ascents.

This system uses a quantitative, evidence-based approach to grading climbs, since the grades can be continuously revised based on ascent data.  The system's basis in a statistical model also means that its accuracy can be measured and compared to other systems. 

Grades based on this system have been integrated into [theCrag.com](https://thecrag.com/article/graid).  They can be found next to the "grAId" in the "Grade Citation" section of the route information.

Results of analyzing a database of Australian ascents with the Climbing Ratings software are discussed in the paper:

The algorithms are based on "Whole-History Rating":
